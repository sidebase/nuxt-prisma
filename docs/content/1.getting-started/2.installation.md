# Installation

First add the `prisma` CLI to your project:
::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm i -D prisma
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add --dev prisma
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i -D prisma
```
::

Then install `nuxt-prisma`:
::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm i @sidebase/nuxt-prisma
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add @sidebase/nuxt-prisma
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i @sidebase/nuxt-prisma
```
::

That's it! `nuxt-prisma` also adds `@prisma/client` as a dependency to your project.

## Requirements

`nuxt-prisma` only needs Nuxt 3 to run. In the future Nuxt 2 or Nuxt Bridge may be supported.
