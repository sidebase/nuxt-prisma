# Quick Start

After [installing the package](/nuxt-prisma/getting-started/installation), add the package to your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
   extends: ['@sidebase/nuxt-prisma'],
})
```

Then initialize the Prisma project, [as described in the Prisma getting started guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases-typescript-postgres#set-up-prisma):
```bash
npx prisma init
```

Edit your `prisma/prisma.schema` file, here we use `sqlite` as a provider and add an `Example` model:
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Example {
  id          String @id @default(uuid())
  description String
  details     String
}
```

Follow the remaining steps of setting up Prisma, e.g., run `npx prisma db push` to push the schema to your database and `npx prisma generate` to generate your database client. [Read through the Prisma quickstart to learn how to use Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart).

#summary
Simplify `nuxt-prisma` integration with sidebase

#content
We developed `nuxt-prisma` as a layer for `sidebase`, the productive Nuxt 3 starter. `sidebase` already integrates `nuxt-prisma` for you and also sets up additional helpers, like running `npx prisma generate` automatically for development and building.

Using sidebase which includes `nuxt-prisma` out of the box is easy, just run:
```sh
npx nuxi@latest init -t community/sidebase
```

That's it! You can now use Prisma in your Nuxt 3 app.

## Use Prisma in Endpoints

To use Prisma in one of your endpoints, you can now easily:
```ts
// file: ~/server/api/example.get.ts
import { usePrisma } from '@sidebase/nuxt-prisma'

export default eventHandler((event) => {
  const prisma = usePrisma(event)

  return prisma.example.findMany()
})
```

::alert{type="info"}Due to an open issue with Nuxt 3, you cannot use Prisma in your server-middlewares, follow [this issue for updates](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/issues/3222#issuecomment-1345195929)::

## Database Setup for Jest / Vitest tests

This layer also includes `resetDatabase` which is a function that quickly bootstrap a clean database, e.g., for a testing setup. Here's how to use it:
```ts
import { describe, beforeEach } from 'vitest'
import { resetDatabase } from '@sidebase/nuxt-prisma'

beforeEach(() => {
  resetDatabase()
})

describe('test that involves the database', () => {
   // Add code that depends on a setup, clean database here.

   // You can also add multiple tests, they won't corrupt each other as the database is cleaned up after every go
})
```

::alert{type="danger"}`resetDatabase` drops all data of the database that is currently configured via the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`, never run `resetDatabase` in production.::

## Sqlite helpers for Development and Testing

This layer further includes `setAbsoluteSqliteDatabaseUrlForPrisma`, which takes a path to a file, ensures that it is absolute and then sets the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to a value of the form `file:/absolute/path/to/db.sqlite`.

This is helpful when you use sqlite in your application: If you would export `DATABASE_URL=file:./db.sqlite` the path `./db.sqlite` is going to be resolved differently by the `npx prisma` command that you run in the project root folder vs. the `new PrismaClient()` call that happens in a non-root folder. This would result in two different `db.sqlite`s being created. `setAbsoluteSqliteDatabaseUrlForPrisma` resolves this issue.

If you do not pass in a path, the current directory will be used.

E.g., to use it for a Nuxt 3 development setup that also includes `vitest` based testing: Edit your `nuxt.config.ts` file to include `setAbsoluteSqliteDatabaseUrlForPrisma`:
```ts
// file: ~/nuxt.config.ts
import { setAbsoluteSqliteDatabaseUrlForPrisma } from '@sidebase/nuxt-prisma'

// Set's `DATABASE_URL=file:/absolute/path/to/your/project/db.sqlite`
setAbsoluteSqliteDatabaseUrlForPrisma('./db.sqlite')

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ... nuxt config
})
```

Then [create a global setup file for `vitest`](https://vitest.dev/config/#globalsetup):
```ts
// file: ~/tests/setupSqliteDbEnv.ts
import { setAbsoluteSqliteDatabaseUrlForPrisma } from '@sidebase/nuxt-prisma'

/**
 * Setup the database environment.
 *
 * This is necessary for the vanilla `sqlite` setup, as it depends on a file that is in an absolute place.
 *
 * As soon as the user adds a `.env` file overwriting `DATABASE_URL` or export `DATABSE_URL` themselves we do not want to set the database url manually any longer.
 *
 */
export const setup = () => setAbsoluteSqliteDatabaseUrlForPrisma('./db.sqlite')
```

Then add the following config key to your `vitest.config.ts` file `test` config:
```ts
{
  test: {
    globalSetup: ['./tests/setupSqliteDbEnv'],
    // reamining config
  },
  // remaining config
}
```

Now `db.sqlite` will always be the in the root folder of your project. You can still run `export DABTASE_URL=something://different` to overwrite `setAbsoluteSqliteDatabaseUrlForPrisma`.
