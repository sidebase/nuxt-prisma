# Quick Start

After [installing the package](/nuxt-prisma/getting-started/installation), checkout the [sidebase "with Prisma" quick start](sidebase/welcome/quick-start#with-prisma) or the [more detailed Prisma description](/sidebase/components/prisma) to get further information.

This page summarizes covers some additional information related to endpoint-usage and testing.

## Use Prisma in Endpoints

To use Prisma in one of your endpoints, you can now easily:
```ts
// file: ~/server/api/example.get.ts
export default eventHandler(event =>  event.context.prisma.example.findMany())
```

This also works in your app-middleware!

## Database Setup for Jest / Vitest tests

The prisma-integration layer also includes `resetDatabase` which is a function that quickly bootstrap a clean database, e.g., for a testing setup. Here's how to use it:
```ts
import { describe, beforeEach } from 'vitest'
import { resetDatabase } from '~/prisma/utils'

beforeEach(() => {
  resetDatabase()
})

describe('test that involves the database', () => {
   // Add code that depends on a setup, clean database here.

   // You can also add multiple tests, they won't corrupt each other as the database is cleaned up after every go
})
```

::alert{type="danger"}`resetDatabase` drops all data of the database that is currently configured via the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`, never run `resetDatabase` in production.::
